# Sex differences in viral entry protein expression, host responses to SARS-CoV-2, and in vitro responses to sex steroid hormone treatment in COVID-19
Epidemiological studies suggest that men exhibit a higher mortality rate to COVID-19 than women, yet the underlying biology is largely unknown. Here, we seek to delineate sex differences in the expression of entry genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2, host responses to SARS-CoV-2, and in vitro responses to sex steroid hormone treatment. Using over 220,000 human gene expression profiles covering a wide range of age, tissues, and diseases, we found that male samples show higher expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, especially in the older group (>60 years) and in the kidney. Analysis of 6,031 COVID-19 patients at Mount Sinai Health System revealed that men have significantly higher creatinine levels, an indicator of impaired kidney function. Further analysis of 782 COVID-19 patient gene expression profiles taken from upper airway and blood suggested men and women present profound expression differences in responses to SARS-CoV-2. Computational deconvolution analysis of these profiles revealed male COVID-19 patients have enriched kidney-specific mesangial cells in blood compared to healthy patients. Finally, we observed selective estrogen receptor modulators, but not other hormone drugs (agonists/antagonists of estrogen, androgen, and progesterone), could reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

This is the code repository for understanding sex difference of covid-19 using big data. 

## Repository structure
### main-analysis
Code and input files for main analysis
- raw: preprocessed data files for ARCHS4 GPL11154 (A), GEO GPL570 (G), and Treehouse OCTAD (T), obtained from machine learning prediction and human annotation (correction). These files are used for main analysis.
- all R code for main analysis, which generates the figures in the main text.

All the R scripts were verified on a RStudio Desktop 1.1.463.

### ml-prediction 
Code, input and output for machine learning models for gender, age and tissue prediction.
- input: we provide ARCHS GPL11154 as an example, which were divided into 5 folds (fold_0-fold_4) for cross validation and fold_all for final prediction.
- all python code for gender-tissue prediction (deep multi-task model), and age prediction (XGBoost model)
- output: prediction results generated by the models.

All the Python scripts were tested under the following environment:
- CUDA Version: 10.2
- Python Version: 3.7
- Pytorch Version:
